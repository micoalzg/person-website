        "description": "Hey there, how are you doing?... You're probably wondering how you found yourself here. Well, it probably means I'm unemployed or looking for a new position. So, let me tell you a little about myself. I graduated back in 2021 amid COVID-19. I'm currently working as a Software Engineer for an AI-powered resource management software company called Mosaic (yes the logo is a copy of Polaroid's logo ðŸ˜…). I do fun stuff like build new features and fix bugs (I KNOW SO FUN). I mainly work with React and Redux. Recently, I was moved on to the backend team and have been scouring StackOverflow for Rails help. During my free time (I don't have much right now) I enjoy weight lifting, playing video games, listening to music, and most importantly eating food. I hope this wall of text gives you the willpower to scroll down and look at the cool timeline."
